<TopBlock>

A **transaction** is a unit of work that only succeeds if every operation within that transaction succeeds. For example, if you update 200 users within a transaction, each update must succeed - if not, all changes are rolled back and the transaction fails as a whole.

Prisma Client supports six different ways of handling transactions for three different scenarios:

| Scenario            | Available techniques                                                |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dependent writes    | Nested writes                                                       |
| Independent writes  | `$transaction` API<br />Batch operations<br />Pre-compute row IDs   |
| Read, modify, write | Idempotent operations<br />Implement optimistic concurrency control |

The technique you choose depends on your particular use case.

## Scenario: Dependent writes

### Solution: Nested writes

## Scenario: Independent writes

- Updating the status field of 100 orders to 'Dispatched'
- Marking 100 emails in Gmail as 'Read'

## Scenario: Read, modify, write pattern
