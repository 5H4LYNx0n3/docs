## Overview

You can view the generated database queries that Prisma Client sends to your database as well as warnings and other information by configuring different _log levels_ in the `PrismaClient` constructor. 



By default, logs are printed to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) so you can directly observe them. Alternatively, you can also configure event-based logging and observe the logs by providing a callback to the `$on()` function.

### Logging to stdout

If you want to print your logs to stdout, you can provide the `LogLevel` values directly to the `log` option:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: ['query', 'info', 'warn'],
});
```

Since stdout is the default, the above code snippet is equivalent to the following one where you're explicitly passing `stdout` to the `emit` option:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'query',
    },
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'info',
    },
    {
      emit: 'stdout',
      level: 'warn',
    },
  ],
});
```

### Event-based logging

If you want to apply some custom logic to your logs, you can also set `emit` to `event`:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  log: [
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'query',
    },
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'info',
    },
    {
      emit: 'event',
      level: 'warn',
    },
  ],
});

// ... must now call prisma.$on(...) in order to handle the logging events
```

If you do this, you need to call the `.$on` function on your `PrismaClient` instance and provide a callback function which then receives the logging event. Depending on the selected log level, the input event will carry different arguments.



Note that `query` contains the SQL query and `params` contains any query parameters for the SQL query.
