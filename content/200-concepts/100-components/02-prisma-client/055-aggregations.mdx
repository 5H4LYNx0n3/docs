<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to count records, aggregate number fields, and select distinct field values.

</TopBlock>

## Aggregate

Prisma Client allows you to `aggregate` <span class="api"></span> on the **number** fields (such as `Int` and `Float`) of a model. The following query returns the average age of all users:

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
    age: true,
  },
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations.avg.age)
```

You can combine aggregation with filtering and ordering. For example, the following query returns the average age of users:

- Ordered by `age` ascending
- Where `email` contains `prisma.io`
- Limited to the 10 users

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
    age: true,
  },
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: 'prisma.io',
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: 'asc',
  },
  take: 10,
})

console.log('Average age:' + aggregations.avg.age)
```

## Count

Use `count` <span class="api"></span> to count the number of records. The following example query counts all users:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count()
```

The following example query counts all users with more than 100 profile views:

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count({
  where: {
    profileViews: {
      gte: 100
    }
  }
})
```

The following example query counts a particular user's posts:

```ts
const postCount = await prisma.post.count({
  where: {
    authorId: 29
  }
})
```

## Select distinct


Prisma Client allows you to filter duplicate rows from a Prisma Query response to a [`findMany`](./crud#findMany) query using `distinct`.  `distinct` is often used in combination with [`select`](./field-selection#select) to identify certain unique combinations of values in the rows of your table.

The following example returns all fields for all `User` records with distinct `name` field values:

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {},
  distinct: ['name'],
})
```

The following example returns distinct `role` field values (for example, `ADMIN` and `USER`):

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const distinctRoles = await prisma.user.findMany({
  distinct: ['role'],
  select: {
    role: true,
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```js
;[
  {
    role: 'USER',
  },
  {
    role: 'ADMIN',
  },
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

### <inlinecode>distinct</inlinecode> under the hood

Prisma's `distinct` option does not use SQL `SELECT DISTINCT`. Instad, `distinct` uses:

- A `SELECT` query
- In-memory post-processing to select distinct

It was designed in this way in order to **support `select` and `include`** as part of `distinct` queries.

The following example selects distinct on `gameId` and `playerId`, ordered by `score`, in order to return **each player's highest score per game**. The query uses `include` and `select` to include additional data:

* Select `score` (field on `Play`)
* Select related player name (relation between `Play` and `User`)
* Select related game name (relation between `Play` and `Game`)

```prisma file=schema.prisma
model User {
  id           Int              @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String?
  Play         Play[]
}

model Game {
  id   Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String?
}

model Play {
  id       Int   @id @default(autoincrement())
  score    Int?  @default(0)
  playerId Int?
  player   User? @relation(fields: playerId, references: id)
  gameId Int? 
  game Game? @relation(fields: gameId, references: id)
}
```

</details>

<CodeWithResult>
<Cmd>

```ts
const distinctScores = await prisma.play.findMany({
  distinct: ['playerId', 'gameId'],
  orderBy: {
    score: 'desc',
  },
  select: {
    score: true,
    game: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
    player: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</Cmd>
<CmdResult>

```
[
  {
    score: 900,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Bert Bobberton' }
  },
  {
    score: 400,
    game: { name: 'Pacman' },
    player: { name: 'Nellie Bobberton' }
  }
]
```

</CmdResult>
</CodeWithResult>

Without `select` and `distinct`, the query would return: 

```
[
  {
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 5
  },
  { 
    gameId: 2,
    playerId: 10
  }
]
```
