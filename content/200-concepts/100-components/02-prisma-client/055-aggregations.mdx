<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to perform aggregations operations on the **number** fields (such as `Int` and `Float`) of a model.

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
      age: true,
  },
});

console.log("Average age:" + aggregations.avg.age);
```

</TopBlock>

## Aggregate

You can combine aggregation with filtering and ordering. For example, the following query returns the average age of users:

* Ordered by `age` ascending
* Where `email` contains `prisma.io`
* Limited to the 10 users

```ts
const aggregations = await prisma.user.aggregate({
  avg: {
    age: true,
  },
  where: {
    email: {
      contains: "prisma.io",
    },
  },
  orderBy: {
    age: "asc",
  },
  take: 10,
});

console.log("Average age:" + aggregations.avg.age);
```

## Count

```ts
const userCount = await prisma.user.count();
```

## Distinct

## Group by
