<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, including related models, and supports a variety of filter conditions.

For example, the following query returns all `User` records with at least one published post and an email address that ends with `prisma.io`:

```js
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Basic filtering


## Operators

## Filter on related records

## Select distinct records when filtering

Prisma Client allows you to filter duplicate rows from a Prisma Query response to a [`findMany`](./crud#findMany) query using `distinct`. 

`distinct` is often used in combination with [`select`](./field-selection#select) to identify certain unique combinations of values in the rows of your table.

```ts
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {},
  distinct: ['name'],
})
```

## Case-insensitive filtering

Case-insensitive filtering [is available as a feature for the PostgreSQL provider](case-sensitivity#options-for-case-insensitive-filtering). MySQL and MariaDB are case-insensitive by default, and do not require a Prisma Client feature to make case-insensitive filtering possible.

To use case-insensitive filtering, add the `mode` property to a particular filter and specify `insensitive`:

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: "prisma.io",
|      mode: "insensitive", // Default value: default
    },
    name: {
       equals: "Archibald" // Default mode
    }
  },
});
```
