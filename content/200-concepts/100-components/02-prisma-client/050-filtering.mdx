<TopBlock>

Prisma Client allows you to filter records on any combination of model fields, including related models, and supports a variety of filter conditions.

The following query:

* Returns all `User` records with at least one published post _and_ an email address that ends with `prisma.io`
* Returns all `User` fields
* Includes all related `Post` records where `published` equals `true`

```js
const result = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: 'prisma.io',
    },
    posts: {
      some: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    posts: {
      where: {
        published: true,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

- [Basic filtering](crud#get-a-filtered-list-of-records) - for example, return 
- [Filter related records](working-with-relations#filter-the-relations-list) - for example, return users and 
- [Filter _on_ related record properties](working-with-relations#filtering) - for example, only return users _with_ at least one published post

Reference:

- Operators list (`AND`, `OR`, `equals`, `contains`)
- Nested operators (`some`, `every`, `none`)

## Case-insensitive filtering

Case-insensitive filtering [is available as a feature for the PostgreSQL provider](case-sensitivity#options-for-case-insensitive-filtering). MySQL and MariaDB are case-insensitive by default, and do not require a Prisma Client feature to make case-insensitive filtering possible.

To use case-insensitive filtering, add the `mode` property to a particular filter and specify `insensitive`:

```ts
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    email: {
      endsWith: "prisma.io",
|      mode: "insensitive", // Default value: default
    },
    name: {
       equals: "Archibald" // Default mode
    }
  },
});
```
