Use [`orderBy`](../../../reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#orderby) <span class="api"></span> to sort a list of records or a nested list of records by a particular field or set of fields. For example, the following query returns all `User` records sorted by `role` and `name`, **and** each user's posts sorted by `title`:

<Cmd>

```ts file=script.ts
const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
  orderBy: [
    {
      role: 'desc',
    },
    {
      email: 'desc',
    },
  ],
  include: {
    posts: {
      orderBy: {
        title: "desc",
      },
      select: {
        title: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

</Cmd>

<CmdResult>

```json
[
  {
      "email": "kwame@prisma.io",
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Kwame",
      "role": "USER",
      "posts": [
          {
              "title": "Prisma in five minutes"
          },
          {
              "title": "Happy Table Friends: Relations in Prisma"
          }
      ]
  },
  {
      "email": "emily@prisma.io",
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Emily",
      "role": "USER",
      "posts": [
          {
              "title": "Prisma Day 2020"
          },
          {
              "title": "My first day at Prisma"
          },
          {
              "title": "All about databases"
          }
      ]
  }
]
```

 to retrieve a single record by ID.
